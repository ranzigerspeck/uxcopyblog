    <div class="article_content">

        <p>
            To explain how a well-structured layout can aid your writing, let’s have a look at an example. 
            Here’s an excerpt from a recipe I came across recently:
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                <i>Heat a frying pan on high heat (no oil). When hot, add the lamb mince and cook until browned, 4-5 mins. 
                Use a wooden spoon to break it up as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper. IMPORTANT: The mince is cooked when browned all over. 
                Reduce to medium heat and add the shawarma seasoning mix, garlic and tomato puree. 
                Stir and cook for 1-2 mins. Add the water (see ingredients for amount), whole and mashed chickpeas and beef stock powder. 
                Mix to combine and allow to simmer for 4-5 mins until thick and saucy.</i>      
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Put yourself in the user's shoes
        </h3>

        <p>
            The excerpt above describes a bunch of steps, ingredients and some “important” information in a single, unstructured block of text. 
            Why is that a problem? Well, let’s imagine our “user” and their cirumstances for a second.  
            By the way, this is a great exercise before tackling any writing challenge.    
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Understand the problem</span><br>
            Most likely, our users are busy home cooks; chopping, frying, cleaning and organising, all at the same time, trying to put dinner on the table. 
            They’re probably even listening to their favourite podcast while they’re cooking. 
            The point is: they’re under a certain level of pressure, they have to juggle several things at once, and they’re probably not entirely focused on the recipe.
        </p>

        <p>
            So when writing this kind of copy, we should assume that our users probably don’t pore over every single word. 
            Maybe they didn’t even read the recipe before they started. 
            In the end, they might miss a crucial step or ingredient hidden somewhere in this block of text. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh no. Dinner is in jeopardy. How do we prevent this tragedy? 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Set a goal</span><br>
            Now that we’ve identified the problem, let’s find a solution. 
            To do that, we’ll set a goal. In this case, I’d say, our goal is to make it easier for our users to cook a dish. 
            And in order to reach this goal, a good layout can be really beneficial. 
            Let’s make this copy easier to read and easier to understand – without changing a single word. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Overall structure: headings
        </h3>

        <p class="copy_with_list">
            First, let’s see if we can find some sort of structure. Ah yes, this part of the recipe comprises of two sections:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cooking the meat
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making the sauce
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            So first, let’s separate these sections and add subheadings. 
            These will also make it easier for the user to scan the complete recipe and get a rough idea of all the necessary steps. 
            In other words, subheadings help make the recipe’s content “scannable”.
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                <span class="bold_black">Cook the meat</span> <br>
                Heat a frying pan on high heat (no oil). When hot, add the lamb mince and cook until browned, 4-5 mins. 
                Use a wooden spoon to break it up as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper.
                IMPORTANT: The mince is cooked when browned all over.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold_black">Make the sauce</span> <br>
                Reduce to medium heat and add the shawarma seasoning mix, garlic and tomato puree. 
                Stir and cook for 1-2 mins. Add the water (see ingredients for amount), whole and mashed chickpeas and beef stock powder. 
                Mix to combine and allow to simmer for 4-5 mins until thick and saucy.    
            </p>
        </div>
       
        <h3>
            Ordering content: Lists and bullet points
        </h3>

        <p>
            Cool. That’s easier. Next step: notice how this recipe is basically just a set of instructions? 
            Almost every sentence starts with a verb – add, use, season, reduce, etc. These are distinct steps for the cook. 
            You don’t want to miss any of these. So let’s give each of them their own line.
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                <span class="bold_black">Cook the meat</span>

                <li>
                    When hot, add the lamb mince and cook until browned, 4-5 mins.

                    Use a wooden spoon to break it up as it cooks. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IMPORTANT: The mince is cooked when browned all over.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <span class="bold_black">Make the sauce</span> 
            <ul class="small_box_list">
                <li>
                    Reduce to medium heat and add the shawarma seasoning mix, garlic and tomato puree.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir and cook for 1-2 mins. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the water (see ingredients for amount), whole and mashed chickpeas and beef stock powder. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix to combine and allow to simmer for 4-5 mins until thick and saucy.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            Nice. Next step: let’s have a look at the flow. 
            Recipes are a sequence of instructions: you heat the pan, then you add the meat, then you salt and pepper it. 
            So let’s turn our bullet points into numbers.
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                <span class="bold_black">Cook the meat</span> 
            </p>
            <ol class="small_box_list">
                <li>
                    Heat a frying pan on high heat (no oil).  
                </li>
                <li>
                    When hot, add the lamb mince and cook until browned, 4-5 mins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a wooden spoon to break it up as it cooks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season with salt and pepper. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    IMPORTANT: The mince is cooked when browned all over.
                </li>
            </ol>
           <br>
            <span class="bold_black">Make the sauce</span> 
            <ol start="6" class="small_box_list">
                <li>
                    Reduce to medium heat and add the shawarma seasoning mix, garlic and tomato puree.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir and cook for 1-2 mins. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the water (see ingredients for amount), whole and mashed chickpeas and beef stock powder. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix to combine and allow to simmer for 4-5 mins until thick and saucy.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            That works nicely, but see bullet points 3 and 4 under “Cook the meat”? They’re not really independent instructions. 
            In fact, bullet point 3 and 4 reference bullet point 2, they are kind of a subsection. So let’s remove the bullet points here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, bullet point 5 isn’t really part of the flow. It’s more of an additional piece of information. 
            So let’s remove it from the flow.
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                <span class="bold_black">Cook the meat</span>

            </ol>
        </div>
    
        <h3>
            Highlighting details: font styles
        </h3>

        <p>
            Let’s highlight two kinds of information that you don’t want to miss: time and ingredients. 
            To do that, we can use font styles or colours, whatever works best. 
            Let's use green for the the time, red for important information and bold for the ingredients. 
            And let's also remove the full stops, this makes it a bit easier to scan through the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            So here we go – our "final" recipe layout:
        </p>
       
        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                <span class="bold_black">Cook the meat</span>

            <ol class="small_box_list">
                <li>
                    Heat a frying pan on high heat (no oil)  
                </li>
                <li>
                    When hot, add the <strong>lamb mince</strong> and cook until browned, <span style="color: green;">4-5 mins</span><br>
                    - Use a wooden spoon to break it up as it cooks<br>
                    - Season with <strong>salt and pepper</strong> 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p style="color: red">
                IMPORTANT: The mince is cooked when browned all over
            </p>
            <span class="bold_black">Make the sauce</span> 
            <ol start="4" class="small_box_list">
                <li>
                    Reduce to medium heat and add the <strong>shawarma seasoning mix</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong> and <strong>tomato puree</strong>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir and cook for <span style="color: green;">1-2 mins</span> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the <strong>water</strong> (see ingredients for amount), <strong>whole and mashed chickpeas</strong> and <strong>beef stock powder</strong> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix to combine and allow to simmer for <span style="color: green;">4-5 mins</span> until thick and saucy
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            Obviously, this is just an example to show some tools you can use. 
            Whenever you’re presented with a wall of text, even if it’s a smaller one, think about how you can make it easier to understand. 
            Layout tweaks can be impactful, and they’re usually easy to implement for both designers and developers.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, there’s also a downside, which will put you at odds with most designers: our revised version takes up a lot more space. 
            But if the information you're trying to convey is important, you should give it the space it needs.
