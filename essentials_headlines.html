    <div class="article_content">

        <p>
            As a UX writer, you’ll encounter different kinds of headlines. 
            On top of blog or news articles, as headings in pop-up messages, payment or onboarding flows, as email subject lines or in push notifications. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Just to get the semantics out of the way: you wouldn’t necessarily call all of those “headlines”. 
            But they all serve a similar purpose and follow similar mechanics. 
            If you’re summarising important information and you want users to act on it, you’re dealing with a headline – at least in a UX writing context.
            So let’s use “headlines” as an umbrella term and find out how they work.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is not a step-by-step guide for writing the perfect headline. 
            It’s a collection of insights and techniques I find useful when writing headlines.
        </p>

        <p class="copy_with_list"> 
            I usually start with these two high-level thoughts:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Get to the point
            </li>
            <li>
                Make it engaging
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Let’s explore what that means and how it works.
        </p>

        <h3>
            1. Get to the point
        </h3>

        <p class="copy_with_list">
            Great headlines condense important information into very few words. 
            Have a look at these historical newspaper headlines:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                “Men Walk on Moon” <i>(The New York Times, July 21, 1969)</i> 
            </li>
            <li>
               “Ford to City: Drop Dead” <i>(New York Daily News, October 30, 1975)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
               “Nixon Resigns” <i>(Washington Post, August 9, 1974)</i>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Why are these headlines so effective? Obviously, they describe major events that shaped the course of history. 
            But they're also successful from a writing perspective, because...
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">They’re short</span><br>
            Like, really short. They condense major events into the smallest amount of words possible. 
            The third headline (“Nixon Resigns”) literally consists of just two words. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">They’re simple</span><br>
            These headlines use simple sentences and simple words. 
            And simplicity is great, because it lets you reach a wider audience. 
            On average, it takes a second-grade reading level to understand all three headlines 
            (you can <a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/" target="_blank" class="text-link">check the readability of your copy with a tool like WebFX's Readability Test</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">They clarify</span><br>
            And because these headlines are so short and simple, they can tell big stories with great clarity.
            Even if you’re hurrying past the newsstand (let’s imagine it’s 1975 for a second), briefly glancing at the newspapers, you’ll know exactly what has happened. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">They summarise</span><br>
            Good headlines summarise complex information effectively. 
            Take, for example, the second headline ("Ford to City: Drop Dead”): in 1975, US President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying federal assistance to spare New York City from bankruptcy. 
            He didn’t actually say “Drop dead” – but it’s an effective way of summing up what his speech meant to the city.
        </p>

        <h3>
            👆 Let's put this into practice
        </h3>

        <p>
            OK, let's say you’re writing a headline for a new photo-sharing app called “PhotoSnapper”. 
            Start by writing down what you want to say. 
            Don’t think about length, grammar or style at this point. 
            Just make sure that all the important information is on the page.    
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, start editing. 
            Let’s say you’re starting with this:
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
               PhotoSnapper is a new app that lets you snap, upload and share your photos with friends, family and people around the world.    
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Focus on the user</span><br>
            When writing about a product, don't just focus on the product itself and how great it is. 
            Instead, show what users can do with it. 
            This puts users in the centre of your communication and gives them a feeling of being in control:
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
               PhotoSnapper <del style="color: red">is a new app that lets you</del> snap, upload and share your photos with friends, family and people around the world.    
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Highlight the key benefit</span><br>
            Focus on the major benefit of your product. 
            You can do this by stripping out any secondary or less important features from your copy.
            In our example, "sharing" is the app's most important feature:
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
               PhotoSnapper <del style="color: red">is a new app that lets you snap, upload and</del> share your photos with friends, family and people around the world.    
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Summarise</span><br>
            Look for other opportunities to summarise. Just like you don’t have to mention every single feature in your headline, you can just go for the biggest user group: 
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
               PhotoSnapper <del style="color: red">is a new app that lets you snap, upload and</del> share your photos with <del style="color: red">friends, family and people around</del> the world.    
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Keep it simple</span><br>
            Have a look at the copy that's left. 
            Note the simple language and how we're addressing users directly (more on that in a minute). 
            Here’s our new, shorter and more engaging headline:
        </p>

        <div class="small_box">
            <p class="small_box_copy">
                PhotoSnapper. Share your photos with the world.    
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>
            2. Make it engaging
        </h3>

        <p>
            We’ve discussed how to write short and clear headlines. 
            But in UX writing, headlines also have to be actionable. 
            They don’t just describe something, they encourage users to take a specific action. 
            So how can we achieve this in our headlines?
            Here's a simple example – asking users to sign up to a newsletter: 
        </p>

        <div class="article_picture_wrapper">
            <img alt="Headline in a pop-up message" class="article_image" src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_low.png" data-src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_1.svg">
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Talk directly to the user</span><br>
            A good starting point is to imagine that you’re having a conversation with your users. 
            You can achieve this by addressing users directly and by leading with a verb. 
            In our newsletter headline example, “Subscribe” serves this purpose. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, don’t refer to yourself or your organisation in the third person. 
            Instead of writing, for example, “Subscribe to <i>PhotoSnapper’s</i> newsletter”, write “Subscribe to <i>our</i> newsletter”.   
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Headlines and CTAs</span><br>
            In many cases, headlines will be paired with CTAs. Of course there’s usually other content between the two, but you should pay attention to the relation between a headline and the CTA. Many users only read the headline and then skip right to the CTA. 
            That’s why it's often a good idea to mirror your headline's lead verb in your CTA:
        </p>

        <div class="article_picture_wrapper">
            <img alt="Headline and CTA relationship in a pop-up message" class="article_image" src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_low.png" data-src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_2.svg">
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Lead with a benefit</span><br>
            You can also front-load your headline with a user benefit. 
            Often, it's not enough to ask users to do something without offering anything in return.
            So let's give it a try:
        </p>

        <div class="article_picture_wrapper">
            <img alt="Headline and body copy duplication in a pop-up message" class="article_image" src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_low.png" data-src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_3.svg">
        </div>

        <p>
            There are, however, two downsides: one, the first line of the body copy is just a repetition of the headline. 
            And two, the connection between the headline and CTA doesn’t work anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold_black">Summarise (again)</span><br>
            So how can we create a headline that still leads with a benefit, but is succinct and encourages the user to take action? 
            By summarising: instead of saying “Save 50% on your next purchase”, we’ll just say, “Save big”. 
            This gives us enough space to add the action we want the user to take back in:
        </p>

        <div class="article_picture_wrapper">
            <img alt="Succinct and engaging headline in a pop-up message" class="article_image" src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_low.png" data-src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_4.svg">
        </div>
        
        <h3>
            Headlines and user flows
        </h3>

        <p>
            In UX writing, a headline is often part of a larger flow. 
            While the example above is a single pop-up, you’ll often write headlines for sign-up, onboarding or payment flows. 
        </p>

        <p>
            That means you can spread the information in your headlines across multiple screens. 
            Ask yourself: what does the user need to know at each point of the flow? 
        </p>

        <p>
            Let’s have a look at an example. 
            We’re designing an onboarding flow for our imaginary app “PhotoSnapper”. 
            On a high level, the structure looks like this:
        </p>

        <div class="article_picture_wrapper">
            <img alt="A simple onboarding flow" class="article_image" src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_low.png" data-src="_assets/essentials_headlines/headlines_5.svg">
        </div>

        <p>
            The “Introduction” headline could just be the one we’ve already written: “PhotoSnapper. Share your photos with the world.” – a short, punchy summary of what the user can do with the app.
        </p>

        <p>
            In “Feature highlights”, we can go into a bit more detail. 
            For example, we could say, “Take brilliant photos” on the first screen and “Easily share photos on your favourite social networks” on the second. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Not the most exciting features, I know, but we’re just talking about the structure of the flow here. 
            Get users interested with your first headlines, explain your product’s top features on the following screens, and, in the “Sign up” section, give them a reason to take action. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This reason can be all kinds of things, whether it’s something intangible (“Join over 1m inspiring creators”) or something that has monetary value (“30-day free trial”), make sure it fits your product story and resonates with your audience.
        </p>

        <h3>
            There are no shortcuts
        </h3>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to a great headline. 
            You’ll probably write dozens of them before you find one or two you’re happy with. 
            Look at your product from different angles, try different stylistic devices, discuss with your team, test your headlines. 
            Do whatever helps you get there, but don't give up: it can be surprisingly complicated to write a simple headline.
        </p>
